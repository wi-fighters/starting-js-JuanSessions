console.log(operation); // this is just going to print the value of 'operation', which is the value of 'options': an array which contains two function expressions (see above)

console.log(operation[0]()); // we are choosing 'addOne', which is contained in the index '0' of the array 'options', and we are running it. The value of 'subtractOne' is the current value of 'number' + '1'. In this moment it will be '1'.

// console.log(operation()); // this throws an error because the value of 'operation' is an array and not a function, so we CAN'T call it like this. We have to call one of the functions inside the array

console.log(operation[1]()); // we are choosing 'subtractOne', which is contained in the index '1' of the array 'options', and we are running it. The value of 'subtractOne' in is the current value of 'number' - '1'. Since the value was '1' before this call, now it's going to be '0'.
