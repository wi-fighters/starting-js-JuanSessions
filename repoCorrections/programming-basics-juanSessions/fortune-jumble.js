// Oh no, the fortune teller got drunk and all the lines of code have been mixed up!

// As the fortune teller's apprentice, it's up to you to
// save the day!

// Here's what you'll have to do:
// - Reorder the lines below
// - Don't delete any code
// - Don't add any code

// Here's what you're aiming for:

// - No global variables
// - Two pure functions
// - One call to console.log that makes use of hoisting
// - Code that runs without errors
// - Proper indentation

// Good luck!

console.log(getFortune()); // here in the begining makes use of hoisting
